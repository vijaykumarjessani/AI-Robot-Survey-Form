# AI Robot Preferences Survey Form 🤖

This is a fun and futuristic survey form built with **HTML and CSS** that collects user preferences for designing their ideal household robot. The goal is to explore form elements while practicing responsive web design and building real projects.

## 🧠 What It Does

The form asks users:
- What voice the robot should have
- What household tasks it should perform
- What personality it should embody
- Whether it should be allowed to babysit
- And much more...
